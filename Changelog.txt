Elaborated planning for the setting, decided not to add extra rooms that aren't in FMP.
Decided to have 4 characters in the game.

2013/11/22
Decided to remove the oval office room.
Settled on rooms: lab, hallway, storage and nighttime hallway.
Structured the story, branches and choices in a pseudo-code form.
Documented various stages of planning with screenshots.
Started writing the scripts, declared character+environment placeholder variables.

Created placeholder images for the 4 room scenes.
The placeholders mean I can work on the code without needing to wait for the actual renders to be created.
Started work on coding the basic structure of the game.

Completed the basic structure of the entire script. It mostly works from start to finish now.
Shifted all ending labels to a separate file for organisational purposes.
